# Vaccine-Tracking-System
                                                        Description
“More than 670 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have now been administered across 151 countries. A range of different vaccines is being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment, or dying.” [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51665497]
Implement an “Egyptian Vaccine Tracking System” in C++. That allows the users to enter their personal and vaccination information and let the administrator calculate basic statistics to draw insights from such data.

What is meant by Egyptian is that it should be specifically tailored to tracking the vaccination process for Egyptians in Egypt in the sense that the National IDs should be 13 numbers, the user can only enter Egyptian governorates, etc
To make things easier, we won’t account for Egyptians living abroad or non-Egyptian residents. Only Egyptian residents.
